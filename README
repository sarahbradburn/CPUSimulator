Simulator.c simulates the following MIPS instuctions from machine language:  
	add, addi, sub, sw, slt, and, j, beq, syscall
The 32 registers are represented by an array of reg structs, defined in Reg.h. 
The simulator is time-driven, using alarm() to represent the clock. 
Memory and registers are printed at each clock tick.

You can run the program using the following command: 
	make -s CFLAGS="-g -Wall -Werror" Simulator && ./Simulator
